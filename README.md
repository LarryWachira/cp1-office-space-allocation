## Installation
The app has a number of dependencies as detailed in the `requirements.txt`. To run it, you'll need to install [Python 3.6](http://python.org) from Python's website and setup a virtual environment as illustrated [here](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/). Dependencies that are built into Python have not been included.

The last and final step will be to install the dependencies by typing `pip install -r requirements.txt`

With that done and git installed on your system, all you need to do now is to clone the repo via the command `git clone https://github.com/LarryWachira/cp1-office-space-allocation.git` and run `python app.py` in your command line to fire up the app.
